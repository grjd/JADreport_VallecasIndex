# Selecting the most important self-assessed features for predicting conversion to Mild Cognitive Impairment with Random Forest and Permutation-based methods

This repository contains the code and the supplementary material of the paper of the paper:

Jaime Gómez-Ramírez, Marina Ávila-Villanueva, Miguel Ángel Fernández-Blázquez, "Selecting the most important self-assessed features for predicting conversion to Mild Cognitive Impairment with Random Forest and Permutation-based method".

## Overview
Using machine learning (random forest) and permutation-based methods we select the set of most important self-reported variables for MCI conversion which includes among others, subjective cognitive decline, educational level, working experience, social life, and diet. Subjective cognitive decline stands as the most important feature for future conversion to MCI across different feature selection techniques.  

## Requirements

### Python Packages
The code relies on the following python3.X+ libs:
* numpy
* pandas
* sklearn
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* graphviz
* shap
* pdpbox
